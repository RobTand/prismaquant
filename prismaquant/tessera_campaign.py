"""Price Tessera's continuous rate axis by anchor campaign.

Four families address thousands of rungs at every shape, and one encode is
seconds.
Rendering the menu is not a cost model, it is a week of a shared GPU.  So this
stage renders a small **measured anchor** set per (unit, family) and fills the
rest of the axis from ``tessera_rate_surface``, which interpolates monotonically
in ``(q256, log2 dloss)`` between bracketing anchors and **refuses to
extrapolate**.  How many anchors that is, is not a constant: round 1 measures
the two endpoints and the middle of each family's legal range, and every
following round adds one anchor wherever leave-one-anchor-out says the
interpolation is worst, until the LOO gate closes or the round budget runs out.

Priced as served
----------------
Every measured rung is scored by the production scorer,
``production_weight_cache._local_forward_render_score`` -- the same function the
render-cost stage uses -- with the **route's own activation quantiser** applied
to the calibration rows.  A Tessera rung on the E2M1 grid over a block plane
decodes to an NVFP4 tensor and executes W4A4, so its cost is measured against an
A4 input; a rung on E4M3 over a CHANNEL plane executes W8A8 and is measured
against a per-token FP8 input.  The same *weight* rate therefore costs
differently on the two routes, which is the whole reason the allocator may not
rank them on weight error alone.

The W4A4 leg is the **served static contract**, not the registry's dynamic
RTN.  ``tessera.serving.nvfp4_route`` reads the artifact's
``trellis_input_global_scale`` and calls vLLM's compiled ``scaled_fp4_quant``
-- a static-global-scale operation whose per-16 block scales are stored as
UE4M3 -- so an E2M1 rung here is scored through
``format_registry.nvfp4_activation_qdq_served`` at the unit's own calibrated
``input_global_scale`` (fused-sibling unified, the same joint the exporter's
scale file carries).  NVFP4's registry callback is a dynamic FP32-scale RTN
that never snaps through UE4M3 and rounds midpoints differently; pricing with
it prices an activation tensor the runtime does not execute
(RobTand/prismaquant#194).  A missing scale refuses rather than falling back
to the dynamic quantiser.

Rendering identity, and the wire
--------------------------------
The render is not ``render_tessera_weight``'s reconstruction; it is
``read_unit_artifact(encode_linear(...).blob)`` (or the equivalent batch
entry) -- **the bytes, decoded**.  So the
cache entry holds the wire beside the dequantised render. Checkpoint resume
verifies those bytes against their producer input receipt. That proves the
cached wire is the priced wire. The packed producer-plan/cached-wire bridge
carries those receipts through allocation and export; actual export/serve
qualification remains the measurement tracked by PrismaQuant #183.

What this stage does NOT do
---------------------------
It measures ``output_mse`` under the route's activation contract, which is the
render-cost currency (``COST_MODE=production-render-score``'s
``--score-field output_mse``).  It is not the AURA adjoint: AURA prices ``dW``
against a KL-Fisher weight gradient and applies the A side afterwards as a
calibrated per-family multiplier, and a Tessera family has no such calibration
yet.  The payload declares its own currency so nothing downstream can mistake
one for the other.

# The routed-expert stack, and the sample that prices it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A routed MoE stack is ONE decision: vLLM loads a packed ``[E, M, N]`` expert
# tensor under a single quantization scheme, and PrismaQuant's union-find
# serving-unit promotion already enforces that (``allocator_solver.
# _packed_groups_by_profile`` keys ``...experts.gate_up_proj`` and
# ``...experts.down_proj`` into the same ``__packed_format__`` group).  The
# campaign measures separate expert Linears, optionally encoding compatible
# units together. A full census still requires every expert's wire and score.
#
# So the campaign may measure a SAMPLE of experts and this module estimates the
# stack from it.  Two things have to be right for that to be honest:
#
# 1. The estimator must be unbiased for the stack's total, not for "the average
#    expert".  With a probability-proportional-to-size draw the Horvitz-Thompson
#    estimator is the one that is: ``T_hat = sum_{e in S} y_e / pi_e``.
#
# 2. The number written into the row must be the quantity the ALLOCATOR will
#    multiply correctly.  ``allocator_solver.predicted_dloss`` prices a row as
#    ``0.5 * h_trace * output_mse``, and it reads ``h_trace`` from the PROBE, so
#    the stack row is multiplied by the packed row's own ``h_trace``.  The
#    quantity that makes that product reproduce the stack's summed per-expert
#    dloss is therefore
#
#        output_mse_stack = ( sum_e h_e * mse_e ) / h_stack
#
#    i.e. the h-weighted MEAN expert MSE, not the sum.  Two independent facts
#    in this repo fix that convention rather than taste:
#
#      * the probe's own identity ``sum_e h_trace_per_expert[e] == h_trace``,
#        which holds to float32 storage precision on all 44 packed rows of
#        ``pq275-2026-09-06/probe-02/probe.pkl`` (2.0e-7 relative on layer 18),
#        so the weights sum to the multiplier the allocator will apply; and
#      * ``allocator_candidates``' own super-item aggregation, which inverts the
#        same product the same way when it has to express a group's summed
#        predicted dloss as one member-shaped MSE:
#        ``effective_mse = base_pred / (0.5 * sum_h)``.
#
# A per-expert member's Fisher weight is ``h_trace_per_expert[e] / R``, where R
# is the number of projections the packed parameter splits into -- the SAME
# split ``tier2_per_expert_counterfactual.expand_packed_expert_rows`` uses, and
# R comes from the profile's ``packed_expert_projection_names``, never from a
# hardcoded ``gate_up_proj -> 2``.

    Returns ``(rows, hessians, token_counts, max_abs)``. Counts describe every
    observed input row, including when Hessians and retained scoring rows are
    disabled; they are calibration provenance, not a Hessian-computation flag.
    ``resource_check(label)`` optionally enforces the caller's existing guard
    before/after each output concat and Hessian CPU transfer. A refusal clears
    owned output tensors before propagating; integer row observations remain
    available for diagnostics. The default performs no additional checks.
    ``on_forwards_complete()`` is an optional source-lifecycle boundary after
    every original forward, hook removal and release of local packed weight
    views. It runs before CPU output materialization, within failure cleanup.
    The caller can release only exhausted source state while retaining the
    next resident layer and current hidden boundaries. The default is None.

    ``shared_packed_inputs`` is an experimental, default-off collector policy.
    Only packed siblings with the same module, expert and derived input kind
    share internal accumulation. The existing store retains private, bounded
    FP32 device prefixes until output materialization; returned CPU H/X tensors
    remain independent for every qname. This is not a new activation cache.

    Three different things come out of the same hook, and they have different
    row budgets on purpose:

    * ``rows`` is capped at ``max_rows`` because it feeds
      ``_local_forward_render_score``, whose cost is linear in rows and whose
      job is to *rank* rungs.
    * ``hessians`` is ``XᵀX`` accumulated over **every** calibration row the
      Linear sees, because it feeds the encoder, whose job is to *build* the
      bytes.  Capping it at ``max_rows`` would hand a 3072-column
      ``down_proj`` a rank-256 Hessian -- rank-deficient by a factor of
      twelve, and wrong in a way no downstream check would catch.  So the
      accumulation runs before the keep's early return, not after it.
    * ``max_abs`` is ``max|x|`` over **every** calibration row, unconditional
      and for the same reason the Hessian is uncapped: it calibrates the
      static NVFP4 ``input_global_scale`` the W4A4 routes are priced and
      served under, and a maximum over a prefix of the rows is a different
      calibration than the one an exporter would take.

    Hessians accumulate in fp32 on the model's device and move to CPU once at
    the end. Legacy scoring chunks move to CPU as observed; the experimental
    policy instead transfers their bounded device prefix at the end. Packed units use the existing
    module-input collector and routing/SwiGLU derivation, and land in the SAME
    three accumulators as a dense Linear -- rows, Hessian and ``max_abs`` --
    so there is one notion of "what the campaign captured" for either
    population, and ``write_export_inputs`` has one input to write.  The
    score-row cap never caps routed rows before the Hessian or the maximum.
    The main-entry gate requires profile-declared projections and the
    producer's planning tool before calibration. The campaign later binds
    that producer projection to these live views before pricing the units
    and carrying their wire receipts into export (PrismaQuant #183).

    """A fixed-size PPS draw over one stack's experts, with exact ``pi``.

    Randomized systematic (Madow) probability-proportional-to-size sampling
    without replacement, with a take-all stratum.  Three parts, each of which
    is load-bearing:

    **Proportional to what.** The stack total the allocator needs is
    ``sum_e h_e * mse_e``.  ``h_e`` is free (the probe already has it) and
    ``mse_e`` costs an encode, so drawing proportional to ``h_e`` leaves only
    the spread of ``mse_e`` in the estimator's variance.  On LFM2.5 layer 18
    the per-expert ``h_trace`` spans 9.6e4 to 7.7e6 (CV ~1.0) while the
    cross-expert spread of ``mse`` at a fixed rung is CV 0.33-0.55, so this is
    where the variance is. A uniform draw with the correct Horvitz-Thompson
    weights remains unbiased, but carries the product's spread. The planner
    requires Fisher weights and provides no uniform fallback.

    **The take-all stratum.** With ``h`` this dispersed, ``n * h_i / sum(h)``
    exceeds one for the largest experts.  Clipping that to one would leave
    ``sum(pi) < n`` and bias the estimate low.  Instead those experts are
    taken with certainty, removed from the frame, and the rest re-solved --
    iterated to a fixed point, which is ``pi_i = min(1, c*h_i)`` for the
    unique ``c`` with ``sum_i min(1, c*h_i) = n``.  The post-conditions
    asserted below (``sum(pi) == n``, every ``pi`` in ``[0, 1]``) are what
    make the Horvitz-Thompson estimator downstream exactly unbiased rather
    than approximately so.

    **The randomized order.** The frame is permuted from the seeded stream
    before the systematic pass.  This is not cosmetic: the practical variance
    estimator for this design (Hartley-Rao, which #290 applies to the prices)
    is derived for randomized-order systematic sampling and is not justified
    under expert-index or ``h``-sorted order.

    Determinism, and what the seed is deliberately NOT: the stream is keyed on
    ``(seed, stack)`` only, never on ``h``.  The probe is not bit-reproducible
    across runs, and systematic sampling is continuous in ``pi``, so a
    re-probed ``h`` perturbs this draw slightly; hashing ``h`` into the seed
    would instead redraw the whole stack on every re-probe.

    An expert with ``h_e == 0`` gets ``pi_e = 0`` and is never encoded, which
    is exact rather than a rounding: under the campaign's Fisher convention a
    token never routed to an expert contributes zero gradient, so its term in
    the total is zero, not merely small.

    Returns the whole draw, including everything a variance estimate needs:
    ``units``, ``inclusion_probability`` (over the full frame), ``certainty``,
    ``permutation``, ``start``, ``size``, ``size_sha256``, ``frame_size``,
    ``random_draws`` and ``method``.

    activation scales, so the export leg must be handed them back or the
    artifact built is not the artifact priced (RobTand/prismaquant#193).

      what ``ActivationSource.from_capture`` loads; the H tensors are the
      campaign's own un-normalised accumulators, the identity is the same
      triple stamped on every cost row, and ``hessian_role: "fit"`` marks it
      as bytes-shaping (Tessera refuses a held-out capture there).  The
      returned ``capture_sha256`` is the content digest of exactly this
      payload (``tessera_export_lane.hessian_capture_sha256``, Tessera's own

      allocation to the payload by it (RobTand/prismaquant#204).  A JSON
      sidecar ``<capture>.provenance.json`` repeats the identity and carries
      the same digest, so it can only ever describe the payload beside it:
      both files are staged and renamed, the old sidecar is removed before
      the new payload lands, and the sidecar lands last -- at no point does a
      sidecar sit beside a payload it does not seal.
    * ``input_scales.safetensors`` -- one ``<unit>.input_global_scale`` F32
      scalar per unit, the exporter's stock-NVFP4 spelling, valued exactly as
      the W4A4 costs were scored.

    ``hessians=None`` is the deliberate weights-only campaign: no capture is

        honest thing to do with it is keep it out of the prices and in the
        record.

        On the ``checkpoint`` path that branch is unreachable, and
        deliberately so: ``menu_mode`` is bound in the journal identity (it is
        one of the ``settings``, and only locations are popped), so a resume
        under a different menu is refused by ``prepare_journal`` before a row
        is read. Evidence arrives only through ``--seed-checkpoint``, which is
        the path whose whole purpose is to cross that boundary.
